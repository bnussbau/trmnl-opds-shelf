## ðŸ“š OPDS Bookshelf for TRMNL

Display your personal bookshelf by connecting to an OPDS feed. 

Remember when people kept bookshelves in their living rooms? Guests would browse the spines, spot a favorite title and suddenly you were deep in a great conversation. But now, in the age of e-readers and digital libraries, our books are invisible. No one knows what youâ€™re reading. The bookshelf has disappeared.

**OPDS Bookshelf for TRMNL brings it back.**

Display your personal digital shelf, live from any OPDS-compatible server, directly onto your TRMNL device. It's the perfect companion for TRMNL Guest Mode, turning your living room e-ink screen into a silent conversationalist. Visitors can browse your current reads and maybe even borrow a recommendation.

## Example

### Use with Calibre Web

1. Set up Calibre Web (https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web)
2. Create a Shelf and add the books you want to show (select "Share with everyone")
3. To expose the feed without Authentication enable "Anonymous browsing" (Admin > Edit Basic Configuration > Feature Configuration > Enable Anonymous Browsing)
4. Get your feed and set it as polling URL in the TRMNL recipe. Copy the shelf URL and prefix /shelf with /opds/shelf (e.g. https://calibre-web.example/opds/shelf/1). Note: without anonymous browsing enabled, you'll need to provide Basic Auth credentials, eg. https://User:Passw0rd@calibre-web.example/opds/shelf/1
